### About Funinki Project
Handy web app to track (manually) our anime watchlist.

This feature is simple, i am just learn about how to use graphql query in curl php.

This is can not be commercial, but i plan to create wordpress plug-in to fetch anime information.

However this app isn't good enough, and i recommend to use https://anilist.co or https://myanimelist.net with Taiga Desktop App to track your watchlist correctly.
